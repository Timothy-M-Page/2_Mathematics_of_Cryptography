# 2_Mathematics_of_Cryptography

This repository contains the mathematics necessary for modern cryptography.

Small descriptions of the mathematics are given before detailing code for
computation. The repository contains the group theory and number theory
behind RSA, algorithms for fast computation of exponents, Pollard's rho algorithm, 
the extended Euclidean algorithm and the Chinese remainder theorem.

The repository also contains a file on linear algebra that details how the
math and numpy packages may be used to compute matrix operations efficiently.
